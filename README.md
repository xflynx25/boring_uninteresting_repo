## Information

1) ***What this project is*** </br>
    This is a future world champion FPL AI. The first lines of code were written on 8/20/20. Onlookers can't fathom the AI's method; they are frozen admiring the success. The wizardry. <br/><br/>The first iteration is an engineered bot modelled after human reasoning. ML is used to predict player scores 
    over varying time periods. Features are derived from player stats, team stats, next opponent stats, 
    positional stats, and attempts to measure the qualitative aspects (transfers, odds, twitter sentiment).
    The predicted points are run through a decision making framework to produce an action for the week (transfers, chips, captain, bench). The chosen action is then executed automatically. 

2) ***How to Configure*** (COMING SOON - This will not work rn)<br/>
    -- Clone amosbastian fpl repository (see contributers section), name it FPL_Remote, and place it in this directory
    -- set up models (or use pretrained)<br/>
    -- set up personality, constants, config files<br/>
    -- run setup.py to install folders<br/>
    -- rerun setup.py when anything has changed <br/>
    -- show how to automate, or can just run manually <br/>

    -- demo video <br/>
    -- docs folder

3) ***Other Notes*** </br>

    -- This will be a decent load on the computer for ~an hour once per week. Days when it does
    not make a transfer will take just a couple minutes. <br/>
    -- Currently it is not 100% automated. Playing chips through amosbastian FPL_Remote does not go through, so humans will be emailed to manually go in and make the changes on the (max 5) weeks where they play chips. This may go to junk mail.


4) ***History*** </br>
    -- 2020-21: 718,084 / 8,240,321 (**8.714%**)


5) ***Status*** </br>

    -- Working to get things more seemlessly integrated for distribution <br/>
    -- Working to allow humans to query an oracle on a website for advice about their team<br/>
    -- Next season to introduce a fully deep learned bot<br/>
    -- Along with to see how well a full season of this bot can do (2020-21 there were bugs all year long)<br/>
