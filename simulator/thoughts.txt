so some sort of config where you can put the data folder 
we want to have csv and the picture because then you can access them easily without code 
want to have a garbage collector or load manager on the data oflder, and size of data entering , maybe config about your max sizing and stuff 
once have csv, and a few good plots, can work to integrate with pyfit, which will involve 
    getting paths and relative imports correct, 
    organizing well, putting things in proper folders 
    figuring out how to do the imports 
    figuring out how we will develop in future in pyfit rather than inside fpl like this 
    figuring out how to get the environment correct 

once this can be imported, add a few more datasets and test with that. 
now supervised learning is working, and you can try it with the current models for fpl 

once we have done this, we can work to implement the RL side of things, which will be more work. Again, first in pyfit 
Then we can try the current models with the full season model 

finally, we can see if we can do an rl 


INITIAL BUGS: 
-------------
the split to avoid outliers in the scatter is not working 
we can just drop the other error plots, but look back into alternative statistics from cv, maybe confusion as well 
want to be able to make plots for as a hyperparameter changes. Maybe this will have to be a full function with training. more like a cv plot. 
    but this connects to the big thing i wanted, which was the hyperparameter searching. So we should have an integrated version as well.

- safety features aka login which only i tell my family 
- want to figure out how to host online 
- want to figure out how to deploy on app store
