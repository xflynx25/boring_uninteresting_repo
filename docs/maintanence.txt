Might need to go in and run patch=True on update_odds_df() in Accountant. Right now, there is no way to determine whether
    we have missed a week of data and just have many canceled games data recorded - or if it is a normal situation. Should 
    eventually correct itself once the excess games start getting played

If you miss odds go to the website: https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php 


YearINT below is 2022 not 2122 for the 21-22 season. We use other format for database. 

YEARLY MAINTANENCE: 
    END OF SEASON (collecting the data):
        *) Season Ends, gw38 is played.
        1) Create new folder Root/Our_Datasets/Yearstring
        2) Copy fix_df, odds, player_raw, team_raw csvs to this folder
        3) Pull the backup odds from https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php, save in folder as {YearINT}_odds_online.csv
        4) Uncomment Accountant.main, and run Accountant.py
        5) Move all the csv and log_exceptions.txt files from Root into a new folder called Root/PastSeasonData/end_season_{YearINT}_backupexcel
    
    OVER SUMMER (training the models): 
        1) Move the models from Current (besides wildcard_copying) into a new folder called Root/models/Yearly/{yearINT}
        2) Add the latest season int to models.py.season_strings
        3) Run the first 2 cells in models.py to train quick 'full' and 'full_squared_error' suites
        4) Copy/Paste a past seasons keeper models
        4) Run 'Evaluator.py validate_new_models' to run a quick test on last year, and check the 
            resulting csv after about an hour to make sure they produced 3000+ point seasons 
        5) Delete the quick production that just happened
        5) Run the first and last (3rd) cell of models.py to produce all the suites, this will take days


    PRESEASON (setting the constants and drafting):
