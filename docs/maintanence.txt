pull the top players info at the end of every season

run the new models

make sure turning computer on to run itself

make sure api is not expiring, and the api has not updated the specifications!!

make sure vastaav is still collecting data

Might need to go in and run patch=True on update_odds_df() in Accountant. Right now, there is no way to determine whether
    we have missed a week of data and just have many canceled games data recorded - or if it is a normal situation. Should 
    eventually correct itself once the excess games start getting played

If you miss odds go to the website: https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php 

dropbox files might not be downloaded and causing problems 


YearINT below is 2022 not 2122 for the 21-22 season. We use other format for database. Why?

YEARLY MAINTANENCE: 
    END OF SEASON (collecting the data):
        *) Season Ends, gw38 is played.
        1) Create new folder Root/Our_Datasets/Yearstring
        2) Copy fix_df, odds, player_raw, team_raw csvs to this folder
        3) Pull the backup odds from https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php, save in folder as {YearINT}_odds_online.csv
        4) Uncomment Accountant.main, and run Accountant.py
        5) Move all the csv and log_exceptions.txt files from Root into a new folder called Root/PastSeasonData/end_season_{YearINT}_backupexcel
    
    OVER SUMMER (training the models): 
        1) Move the models from Current (besides wildcard_copying) into a new folder called Root/models/Yearly/{yearINT}
        2) Add the latest season int to models.py.season_strings
        3) Run the first 2 cells in models.py to train quick 'full' and 'full_squared_error' suites
        4) Copy/Paste a past seasons keeper models
        4) Run 'Evaluator.py validate_new_models' to run a quick test on last year, and check the 
            resulting csv after about an hour to make sure they produced 3000+ point seasons 
        5) Delete the quick production that just happened
        5) Run the first and last (3rd) cell of models.py to produce all the suites, this will take days


    PRESEASON (setting the constants and drafting): 
        - change constants (year & wlidcard)
        - copy over the old personalities, change the years
        - fill out human_inputs_meta (itb, ft, chips, & set pts to 0), human_inputs_players (from vaastav)
        - don't need to have human_outputs since we have safe_read_csv makes it automatically
        - should be ready to run overseer.py
        - after it works in week 2, can set up the cronjob
        - the api key might have run out if odds aren't updating properly 


PROBLEMS WITH SIMPLE MAINTENANCE: 
. some hardcoded filepaths in personalities, and seasons that need to be manually changed
. should make the distinction between just gathering data for my personal datasets, and acting on data for the teams -- more clear. 
    We should want it to do a quick data collection of things like injuries and price and stuff to build up our dataset, 
    but not go through all the ml computatins and stuff.
