Trying a new preseason.py
Also, want to have output of running to update a txt file, and will be displayed to me 
    on bash startup. This way, as long as I open bash every day, I will know whether I need 
    to do something. This is all foiled if I can't pull my information though bcz can't log in. 
Maybe I can use the same method as I did for the top players teams, to get information about myself.

You have to after the first week pull the backup odds into your folder or else whenever there
    is odds that can't resolve it will throw an error.
We get nice prints about the odds situations but isn't in human readable completely so hard to debug
Maybe they flag accounts. athenap and mercury were working for several iterations, but athena.a is getting the state timeout
    problem with login which means they used a captcha. 
Processed Players is taking 23.44 minutes, this seems long for week 2. Lets continue to keep track. (although only 1nc a week so nbd)

Trying to put a priority order on things:
1) Put it on git
1.1) see if you can recover the old version to practice
2) fork the overseer file anyways and make the old one OldOverseer.py 
3) The new one doesn't do these asyncio pick team, make transfer, get team 
4) look at the odds and figure outhow to make human visible printing
5) Implement the new overseer methods 
6) Organize the data notetaking files better.

The new method is working, although a few things need to be ironed out to maximize automation. Like recording the purchase price, and then pulling the current price. 
    & updating the inputs file when we are creating the outputs file at the end. 
FEATURE: the user should need to read only a text file. It should paragraph itself and label by date like this, and should report things like:
    no transfer decided today
    transfer out ___ for ____, no chip, captain, vc = ___, ___, and bench order is ______, ______
